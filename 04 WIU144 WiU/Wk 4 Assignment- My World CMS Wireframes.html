<div class="activity frickin-magic"><div class="overview"><h2>My World - CMS Wireframes</h2>

<p>CMS is an acronym for Content Management System. Today’s web is developed to provide business owners with the ability to act as administrators of their own websites. Static websites are almost a thing of the past, as we move towards a dynamic web. With the implementation of server side scripting languages like PHP, ASP and Cold Fusion, administrators can now login to their own custom built CMS to add, modify and delete content or content sections on the fly, without the need to learn the coding aspects which make this all possible. It is the job of the Interaction Designer to present this extra flexibility and control in such a way as to be understandable by someone with no programming skills or computing intuition. 

THIS EXERCISE IS DUE AT THE BEGINNING OF LECTURE 8.</p></div>

<div class="instructions">
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
Design the worldsurf.com “My World” CMS page. Use the Functional Specifications Document to: 
<li>Create high-fidelity wireframes with annotations, to represent content & interactivity in the Ui, as well as the design patterns used.</li>
<li>Your wire should include branding, navigation and the placement of graphical content elements (icons) used to inform the administrator on how to use the CMS.</li>  
<li>Represent the best placement for form instructions and editable content regions.These should include labels, inputs and controls, as well as the proposed interactivity and feedback available to the user (buttons, error messages, input hints and prompts, click-n-drag with magnetism, resizing, modes, etc).<li/>
<li>* Please note: your wire & screens should show the user logged-in to represent the “members only” content</li>
<li>* Use “Annotations” to describe the patterns used and the reasoning for their use.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
When you have completed this exercise:
<li>Compress your documents for web delivery using .jpg format</li>
<li>Save your wireframes as:  WiU????_Lab7wire_last name_first name_1.jpg (???? = YYMM)</li>
<li>Zip these wires together and save this zip file as: WiU????_Lab7_last name_first name</li>
<li>Submit your zip file using the form provided by the lab instructor/course director</li>
<li>* Please note: wires submitted without  “Annotations” or “low-fidelity”, will receive a grade of 0.</li>
</ul>
