<div class="activity frickin-magic"><div class="overview"><h2>Homepage Wireframe</h2>

<p>When developing a solution for any clients Ui you should adhere to any functional specifications required for the Ui, as they are outlined in the functional specifications document. Wireframes are a great way to represent all aspects of a Ui with a lot less development time. They are meant to be a rough outline of the final Ui. Once the client has approved the wireframe, you can then precede to the visual design of the Ui. These designs are commonly referred to as “design comps” or “screens” (short for screen shots) and should reflect the final look and feel of the entire Ui. In other words design comps should look exactly like the finished product, as it will exist online.</p>

<p>What is a functional spec? The main goal of a functional specifications document is to outline the functionality and criteria required for the website or application and is usually drafted during the Concept Phase of the project. It is meant to act as a blueprint that can be referred to by the client and developer during the course of the project to ensure all project requirements have been met. Once the document has been reviewed and signed off by both parties, the Design Phase can begin. </p></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<p>Design the homepage for worldsurf.com. Use the Functional Specifications document provided to:</p> 
<li>Create a high-fidelity wireframe with call outs, to outline the placement of content within the Ui </li>
<li>Your wire should include branding, navigation (and sub nav if appropriate), the placement of graphical content elements (icons) within their grouped content sections, as well as copy placement and the proposed interactivity available to the user (buttons, links, etc). </li>

</ul>

<ul>
<p>When you have completed this exercise:</p>
<li>Compress your documents for web delivery using .jpg format</li>
<li>Save your wireframe as:  WiU????_Lab4wire_last name_first name (???? = YYMM)</li>
<li>Save your Ui as:  WiU????_Lab4Ui_last name_first name (???? = YYMM)</li>
<li>Zip these documents together and Save this zip file as: WiU????_Lab4_last name_first name</li>
<li>Submit your zip file using the form provided by the lab instructor/course director</li>
<li>* Please note: wires submitted without "call-outs" or "low-fidelity", will receive a grade of 0.</li>
</ul>
