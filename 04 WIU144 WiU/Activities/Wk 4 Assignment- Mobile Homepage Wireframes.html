<div class="activity frickin-magic"><div class="overview"><h2>My World - Mobile Wireframes</h2>

<p>Mobile device usage has increased dramatically in recent years. This increased usage, coupled with an increasingly competitive market has made the purchase of mobile devices more affordable. Today, more people access the web using their mobile device than they do using their home desktop computers. This is largely due to the increase in processing and connectivity available on most modern mobile devices. As a designer, it is your job to focus on these users. Know what their primary needs are, what they want and expect, and how much they are willing to tolerate, in order to create a more effective and enjoyable mobile experience. The information discussed and provided should help get you started. 

THIS EXERCISE IS DUE AT THE BEGINNING OF LECTURE 8.</p></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
Re-design the worldsurf.com homepage page for mobile users. Use the Functional Specifications Document to:  
<li>Create high-fidelity wireframes with annotations to represent the content & interactivity available in the interface, as well as the design patterns used.</li>
<li>Your wire should include everything outlined in the functional specifications document, as well as appropriate branding, navigation, and a predominant call-to-action. The design strategy should support efficient methods for exploring information using a handheld device.</li>  
<li>* Please note: your wire should show reflect everything required on the homepage, and should be structured to support mobile visitors, using the design patterns discussed in lecture and in the textbook.</li>
<li>* Use “Annotations” to describe the patterns used and the reasoning for their use.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
When you have completed this exercise:
<li>Compress your documents for web delivery using .jpg format</li>
<li>Save your wireframes as:  WiU????_Lab7wire_last name_first name_1.jpg (???? = YYMM)</li>
<li>Zip these wires together and save this zip file as: WiU????_Lab7_last name_first name</li>
<li>Submit your zip file using the form provided by the lab instructor/course director</li>
<li>* Please note: wires submitted without  “Annotations” or “low-fidelity”, will receive a grade of 0.</li>
</ul>
