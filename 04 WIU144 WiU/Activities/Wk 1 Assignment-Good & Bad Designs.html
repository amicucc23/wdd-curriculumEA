<div class="activity frickin-magic"><div class="overview"><h2>Good and Bad Designs in the Real World</h2>

<p>Interaction design has become a hot commodity. More and more companies are turning to interactive designers to help them discover ways to improve the products they create. By thinking of all the various ways users will interact with these products, designers can work to improve the usability aspects, thus increasing the potential that people will want to continuing using it. In other words, if it's hard to figure out or use, people won't use it.

THIS ACTIVITY IS DUE AT THE BEGINNING OF LECTURE 2.</p>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to get you thinking about everyday artifacts that we all interact with in the real world. Don't think computers or phones, think analog or tangible. What makes these things work? More importantly, what makes them work so well?</p></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Find 3 examples each of good & bad design on or around Full Sail's campus</li>		
<li>Take a picture of your FS badge with the artifact (optimize for web to reduce file size)</li>		
<li>Paste each artifact picture into this word document</li>		
<li>Below each picture identify these things about the artifact shown: (use black font)</li>		
<li>Where the artifact is located (if outside of campus please provide exact location)</li>
<li>Description of the artifact (what it does / what is its intent)</li>		
<li>What makes it a good or bad design (based on the artifacts intent)</li>
<li>If good, list and define how each usability factor is supported within the design</li>
<li>If bad, what aspects of the design could be improved to make it more usable</li>		
<li>Be prepared to present your findings in our next lecture (peer evaluation)</li>
